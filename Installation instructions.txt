This applies to the Lgv20, I just found out some new information that I never knew before, if you make a change in the mixer_paths file and restart the phone the QuadDAC does not update to the new code, it retains the code that it already has in it's memory. You must flash the twrp file then power off your phone, remove your battery and then hold the power button down for 10 seconds. Then the QuadDAC will update it's code from the mixer_paths file. huh, I learn something new everyday. I found this out by flashing the uninstaller I made to remove all the modifications I made to my Lgv20, it restores all the stock audio files. However I could still hear that my phone was running in True Native Mode, it was still loud. That's how I found this information.
