The acclimation process has to be done with a direct connection to the QuadDAC, with a 24bit Hi-Res music player using wired headphones. I recommend using FLAC files. It will take about an hr or two of playing music for the DAC to acclimate, or burn in the DAC, then the DAC will start to generate some crazy good audio, the longer you play music the superior the audio quality will get, tell the DAC has reached it's maximum velocity. You will need to lower your bass and treble and adjust it again. It is my professional opinion to stay on one flavor and v142.1 or higher after the DAC has fully acclimated. I would imagine this acclimation process happens by the manufacture, before the Hi-Res music player is ready to be sold.

Just push the QuadDAC make it work, crank up the bass and treble. Don't blast out your ear drums, I don't think it's so much the volume level, but the amount of work the DAC has to do, such as the amount of bass and treble it has to produce. The settings in Poweramp of bass 50% and treble 60% should do the trick. Play some music with a lot of bass, like Reputation by: Taylor Swift. We want to tell the QuadDAC to wake up!!!
