The acclimation process has to be done with a direct connection to the QuadDAC, with a 24bit Hi-Res music player using wired headphones. I recommend using FLAC files. It will take about an hr or two of playing music for the DAC to acclimate to the new pristine DAC code, then the DAC will start to generate some crazy good audio, the longer you play music the superior the audio quality will get, tell the DAC has reached it's maximum velocity. You will need to lower your bass and treble and adjust it again. It is my professional opinion to stay on one flavor and v142.1 or higher after the DAC has fully acclimated. I would imagine this acclimation process happens by the manufacture, before the Hi-Res music player is ready to be sold.
