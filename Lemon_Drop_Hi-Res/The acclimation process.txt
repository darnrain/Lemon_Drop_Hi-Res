The acclimation process has to be done with a direct connection to the QuadDAC, with a 24bit Hi-Res music player using wired headphones. I recommend using Poweramp because of the adjustable EQ. You can get a 14 day trial. Because the QuadDAC has been messed up for 7+ years, the DAC will need some burn in time, before we will be able to hear what True Native Mode can sound like. The volume levels are not what's going to wake up the QuadDAC, but the amount of work the DAC has to do, such as the amount of bass and treble it has to produce. A volume level of 40 should be enough. I recommend using the Poweramp profile HIFIMAN RE600. The settings in Poweramp of bass 30% and treble 50% should be a good starting point. I recommend using this album to burn in the DAC, Reputation by: Taylor Swift. Then after awhile or when you think the DAC is not improving, turn up the bass and treble by 5%, then increase tell you get to bass 60% to treble 80%. If the DAC is getting to loud for you, turn down your volume. We want to tell the QuadDAC to wake up!!!

Note: Your welcome to take your headphones off for the burn in process. I have no idea how long to do this for, this has never been done before in history to my knowledge. I guess tell the left channel sounds good. Also after the DAC is acclimated on v160.1, I do not recommend downgrading to any previous version of Lemon Drop Hi-Res. They all have that bug I was talking about.
