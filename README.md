# Welcome to the future of music...
## An addon for the Lgv20 running Stock Oreo
## That transforms Stock Oreo into the Lemon Drop Hi-Res Rom.
### For rooted Lgv20 phones only. 
The worlds first 24/32bit QuadDAC in True Stereo!<br>
The 16bit side is set at: 64bit, 176.4kHz with 6411 channels and upsampled 4X from 16bit, 44.1Khz<br>
The 24bit side is set at: 384bit, 705.6kHz with 24576 channels and upsampled 16X from 16bit, 44.1kHz<br>
Running in True Native Mode.<br>
With all 4 DACs running independently.<br>
DAC 0 = low-range<br>
DAC 1 = mid-range<br>
DAC 2 = high-range<br>
DAC 3 = offload<br>

Please listen at a safe volume level.<br>

Lemon Drop Hi-Res development stage: Number four.<br>
 
1. You need to program the QuadDAC.<br>
2. You need to setup the QuadDAC.<br>
3. You need to check for errors or typos in your code.<br>
4. The worlds best Professional High Resolution Audio Player!<br>

latest release: v206.1<br>

### Introduction:

I absolutely refuse to listen to music that sounds like absolute crap. Even if it takes me over a year, to fix the issue. This is me rectifying, what was so clearly wrong! Everyone in the world deserves the absolute very best, after they took away stereo music from everyone in the world! "If a man injures his fellow man, then what he has done should be done to him. Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, the same sort of injury he inflicted should be inflicted on him." — Leviticus. 24:19–20<br>

"We live in a crooked world, with crooked people, with crooked music".<br>

“I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.”<br>
— Thomas Edison<br>

### My music does not sound Overpowered sometimes?
Can be due to the following:<br>
1. The QuadDAC was not able to acquire the precise Ohm rating of your headphones, to fix unplug your headphones and plug them back in.<br>
2. The phone is in low power mode.<br>
3. Your battery is to low, it is undetermined on how much battery power we must have. I would say at least over 15%.<br>

### What is True Native Mode on a computer?<br>

"(1) The normal running mode of a computer, executing programs from its built-in instruction set. Contrast with emulation mode. See native language. (2) The highest performance state of a computer."<br>

### What is True Native Mode on the Saber ESS 9218 DAC?<br>

I created all 4632 lines of v3.0 True Native Mode code myself, with the help of sed, awk, echo, nano and l3afpad. True Native Mode it's self places the QuadDAC into it's highest performance state. Not only does it place the QuadDAC in it's highest performance state, you also have root access to program the QuadDAC, anything you can imagine. This is what I imagined: The worlds first 24/32bit QuadDAC in True Stereo! The very essence of True Native Mode it's self allows the QuadDAC, to have more than two channels for stereo. The more channels, the better the audio sounds to us.<br>
