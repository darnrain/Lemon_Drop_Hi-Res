# Welcome to the future of music...<br>
## An addon for the Lgv20 running Stock Oreo
## That transforms Stock Oreo into the Lemon Drop Hi-Res Rom.
### For rooted Lgv20 phones only.
The Lgv20 was first with the Android Nougat operating system.<br>
Now it's the first running in True Native Mode.<br>
With all 4 DACs enabled.<br>
A total of 98,304 channels in true stereo.<br>

Warning!!!<br>
Lemon Drop Hi-Res is more than capable of causing permanent damage to your hearing.<br>
Please listen at a safe volume level.<br>

Lemon Drop Hi-Res development status: Active.<br>
latest release: v165.1<br>

### Updates:
If you all were wondering why I left XDA, I will tell you. It's because these LineageOS devs were telling people that "I suck at programing and do not use Lemon Drop HI-Res, it will drain your battery" and stuff like that. Well I guess they found me again, I keep getting emails from comments on GitHub, telling me to "Please stop lying to people.". What does that even mean? They could be a little more descriptive in what they are trying to convey. Why would I lie to people about programing a QuadDAC? The 8,000 lines of code that I programed, is in the mixer_paths file for everyone to see. So I just wanted to let everyone know that I am being harassed, because I did the impossible by programing a QuadDAC for True Native Mode. I had no idea I was that good at programing that people would get upset. Tell you what guys, I will tone it down a little, we will see if that makes them happy.<br>

I was going to stop working on this project, but then I thought to myself? Why should I have to quit working on what I LOVE doing, just because there are some people out there upset at me for recreating there True Native Mode code? I say they should not leave there stuff just lying around were people can find it. Yes I knew the whole time that you guys were not LineageOS devs, when you asked me where I got the ctl files from and what resource I was using? Sorry but finders keepers...<br>
