## Welcome to the future of music...
### A twrp flashable file that transforms
### Stock Oreo into the Lemon Drop Hi-Res Rom.
### For rooted Lgv20 phones only. 
Welcome to the worlds best & first 24/32bit QuadDAC in True Stereo!<br>
The 16bit side is set at: 64bit, 176.4kHz with 6411 channels and upsampled 4X from 16bit, 44.1Khz<br>
The 24bit side is set at: 384bit, 705.6kHz with 24576 channels and upsampled 16X from 16bit, 44.1kHz<br>
24bit QuadDAC 24 X 4 = 96<br>
Running in True Native Mode.<br>
With all 4 DACs running independently.<br>
DAC 0 = low-range - volume 51 - 96bit - 176.4kHz - 6144 channels.<br>
DAC 1 = mid-range - volume 53 - 96bit - 176.4kHz - 6144 channels.<br>
DAC 2 = high-range - volume 55 - 96bit - 176.4kHz - 6144 channels.<br>
DAC 3 = offload - volume 57 - 96bit - 176.4kHz - 6144 channels.<br>

Please listen at a safe volume level.<br>

Latest version: v223.1<br>

### Introduction
The world needs to prepare for the inevitable. This will absolutely change the world, as you know it. Some will be happy, some will not be happy. I have made the executive decision. Based on a number of factors one being, that it is unjust that they only provide extremely poor audio quality that’s free. It's not even stereo. At least have the decency to tell the world the truth, they must pay for stereo. Everyone thinks they are going deaf in there left ear. Whoever messed up the free audio may think that’s funny, but I’m not laughing. The open source community will have the very best audio, known to mankind.<br>

### My music does not sound Overpowered sometimes?
Can be due to the following:<br>
1. The QuadDAC was not able to acquire the precise Ohm rating of your headphones, to fix unplug your headphones and plug them back in.<br>
2. The phone is in low power mode.<br>
3. Your battery is to low, it is undetermined on how much battery power we must have. I would say at least over 15%.<br>

### What is True Native Mode on a computer?<br>

"(1) The normal running mode of a computer, executing programs from its built-in instruction set. Contrast with emulation mode. See native language. (2) The highest performance state of a computer."<br>

### What is True Native Mode on the Saber ESS 9218 DAC?<br>

I created all 4632 lines of v3.0 True Native Mode code myself, with the help of sed, awk, echo, nano and l3afpad. True Native Mode it's self places the QuadDAC into it's highest performance state. Not only does it place the QuadDAC in it's highest performance state, you also have root access to program the QuadDAC, anything you can imagine. This is what I imagined: The worlds first 24/32bit QuadDAC in True Stereo! The very essence of True Native Mode it's self allows the QuadDAC, to have more than two channels for stereo. The more channels, the better the audio sounds to us.<br>
