# Welcome to the future of music...<br>
## An addon for the Lgv20 running Stock Oreo
## That transforms Stock Oreo into the Lemon Drop Hi-Res Rom.
### For rooted Lgv20 phones only.
The Lgv20 was first with the Android Nougat operating system.<br>
Now it's the first running in True Native Mode.<br>
With all 4 DACs enabled.<br>
Set at: 384bit, 705.6kHz, 24576 channels.<br>

Please listen at a safe volume level.<br>

Lemon Drop Hi-Res development stage: Number three.<br>

1. You need to program the QuadDAC.<br>
2. You need to setup the QuadDAC.<br>
3. You need to check for errors or typos in your code.<br>
4. Finished.<br>

latest release: v190.1<br>

I recommend only using v185.9 or higher.<br>

“I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.”<br>
— Thomas Edison<br>

### My music does not sound Overpowered sometimes?
Can be due to the following:<br>
1. The QuadDAC was not able to acquire the precise Ohm rating of your headphones, to fix unplug your headphones and plug them back in.<br>
2. The phone is in low power mode.<br>
3. Your battery is to low, it is undetermined on how much battery power we must have. I would say at least over 15%.<br>

### What is True Native Mode on a computer?<br>

"(1) The normal running mode of a computer, executing programs from its built-in instruction set. Contrast with emulation mode. See native language. (2) The highest performance state of a computer."<br>

### What is True Native Mode on the Saber ESS 9218 DAC?<br>

I created all 4632 lines of the True Native Mode v3.0 code myself, with the help of sed, awk, echo, nano and l3afpad, there are 786 mixer paths for True Native Mode that places the QuadDAC into it's highest performance state. The very essence of True Native Mode it's self allows you to overclock the QuadDAC, 1024bit, 2822.4kHz with a total of 393216 channels.<br>
