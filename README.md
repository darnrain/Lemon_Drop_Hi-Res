What's the the most important thing I need to do, before I root the Lgv20?

Before you flash the KDZ to downgrade your firmware for rooting, make a DUMP with LGUP all files, you don't need to dump system or cache. Put it in a very safe place, like google drive. It will have your EFS and your EFS has the IMEI number of that particular phone. If your EFS ever becomes corrupted then you can re-flash your EFS from your backup to get cell signal working again.

Can I just edit step3.bat and install the latest twrp in there?<br>
No. You need the old version of twrp to format data, then you can update twrp to the latest version. You only need to remove the encryption on the data partition once, when rooting your phone. The old version of twrp is the only version I know of, that can remove the encryption on the data partition.

My camera does not work after installing Lemon Drop Hi-Res?
If you were on LIneageOS or crDroid and then flashed Stock Oreo, then your camera may not work afterwords. The only fix that I know of is to root your phone again. Flash the KDZ to downgrade your firmware and root again.

What is the EFS?
"EFS stands for Encrypting File System, which is really important part of networking and communication for Android Smartphones, It also contains your device IMEI data."

Can all Lgv20 phones be rooted?
Most but not all.

Can my LS997 install the Lemon Drop Rom?
As far as I know there is no Oreo Stock rom for the LS997, so Auto_Debloat will not work on that model of phone. But you may be able to install Lineage OS depending on your firmware. Check your ARB.

Known issues.

When using wired headphones the DAC needs to say on all the time, or you will have no audio and video will run slow. It's due to Hardware-Offloaded Audio Processing, in other words all the audio is routed through the ESS DAC. No software audio decoding on Lemon Drop Hi-Res, it's all hardware.
