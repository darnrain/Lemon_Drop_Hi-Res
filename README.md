# Welcome to the future of music...<br>
## An addon for the Lgv20 running Stock Oreo
## That transforms Stock Oreo into the Lemon Drop Hi-Res Rom.
### For rooted Lgv20 phones only.
The Lgv20 was first with the Android Nougat operating system.<br>
Now it's the first running in True Native Mode.<br>
With all 4 DACs enabled.<br>
A total of 196,608 channels in true stereo.<br>

Please listen at a safe volume level.<br>

Lemon Drop Hi-Res development status: Active.<br>
latest release: v172.4<br>

### Introduction:
First off I want to say, I try to keep my writing to rated PG. (pretty good) Also I do have a very good sense of humour. I never understood why some people are serious all the time, life's too short for that.<br>

If you all were wondering why I left XDA, I will tell you. It's because these LineageOS devs were telling people that "I suck at programing and do not use Lemon Drop HI-Res, it will drain your battery", saying everything they can to try and discourage people from using Lemon Drop Hi-Res. It actually doesn't bother me one iota, if not a single person out there wants to use Lemon Drop Hi-Res, I designed and created Lemon Drop Hi-Res entirely for me and me alone. I like to share, that's just who I am. I absolutely love my Lgv20 and I don't plan on ever buying a new phone ever! The Lgv20 has everything and more I could ever ask for in a cell phone, not to mention a removable battery. If the Lgv20 did not have a removable battery, then I would have never created Lemon Drop Hi-Res. Why spend over 3+ years on a cell phone that has a non-replaceable battery? By the time I was done developing and creating Lemon Drop Hi-Res, most everyones battery would be ready to be replaced about the time I was done.<br>

Well I guess they found me again, I keep getting emails from comments on GitHub, telling me to "Please stop lying to people.". What does that even mean? They could be a little more descriptive in what they are attempting to convey. Why would I lie to people about programing a QuadDAC? The 14,000 lines of code that I have written, is in the mixer_paths_tasha.xml.modded file for everyone to see. Who knows, maybe they genuinely think I am trying to cause harm to peoples phones? That is absolutely not true. I just wanted to have a little fun programing a QuadDAC and increasing the audio quality on my Lgv20. After thinking about that last statement, that does sound kinda odd. I mean who even attempts to program a QuadDAC in there spare time? Furthermore is it even possible to program the QuadDAC on the Lgv20? Haha the answer is yes, if your good at programing code, math and you enjoy a good challenge. My 34 years of computer experience helps also. I suppose some people do have a hidden agenda, mine would be, I wanted to show off my advanced computer skills, and I wanted to own one of the only cell phones, that has the absolute best audio quality out of any cell phone in the entire world.<br>

I remember three years ago, looking at the mixer_paths.xml file, saying to myself there has to be something in this file I can change to increase the audio quality of the QuadDAC? Little did I know that three years later, I would discover all of it's mysteries. ;)<br>

As of a direct result of the harassment from the LineageOS devs, no one can open an issue or leave a comment on any of my projects on GitHub. It's fascinating to me how one little decision in life can and in some cases will have an extremely large outcome. I'm absolutely positive that True Native Mode would not be working yet. I need 100% uninterrupted total concentration, to program the QuadDAC. I cant have people telling me to stop liying, when I am on the precipice of one the greatest breakthroughs in the entire history of mankind.<br>

It's funny, but the LineageOS devs reminds me exactly of when your watching a movie and your just getting lost in the movie, then all of a suddenly out of nowhere, this HUGE fly shows up and wants to fly right in front of your face. Where's my certified, LineageOS dev fly swatter. lol<br>
