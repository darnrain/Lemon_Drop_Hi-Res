Welcome to v164.1
This version was created and designed specifically for those that want to duplicate what I have done on there phone, that has a QuadDAC like the Lgv20. No changes were made to this version compared to v163.1. Only my notes were changed. I have made a guide in the mixer_paths_tasha.xml.modded file that you can follow, this is the only version I recommend using if you want to duplicate what I have done. All the past versions had my notes when I was programing the QuadDAC, I would not imagine that they were very user friendly.

It is my understanding that the two files responsible for making this all happen are, audio_platform_info.xml and mixer_paths_tasha.xml. This is only a theory, I am 99.9% positive, that you only need to mod those two files. If the QuadDAC was going through the Android mixer, then the audio would be down sampled. I have disconnected the DAC from the Android mixer in file audio_platform_info.xml so it’s outputting directly to wired headphones at 32bit 352.8kHz. That is why I think you only need to mod those two files. All the other files are associated with the Android mixer and are the left over reminisce of my previous attempts of trying to increase the audio quality on the Lgv20 without avail. Duplicate all the changes I made leaving intact your unique settings in your mixer_paths.xml file. This will take you some time, it took me months upon months to program all that code in the mixer_paths file. I made notes in both files, to help you along the way. This is not for the novice computer user. The mixer_paths file must have zero typos, zero mistakes, zero errors. The QuadDAC also needs Enable System wide QuadDAC support v8.2 aka build.prop audio tweaks.

Those on Lemon Drop Hi-Res v163.1, you do not need to upgrade to this version. However you can upgrade to this version if you would like to be on the latest and greatest. ;)

If you all were wondering why I left XDA, I will tell you. It's because these LineageOS devs were telling people that "I suck at programing and do not use Lemon Drop HI-Res, it will drain your battery" and stuff like that. Well I guess they found me again, I keep getting emails telling me to "Please stop Lying to people." So I have disabled all comments and issues for 6 months, just in case your wondering why they are disabled. I wonder if they know that, I was already 100% done programing the Saber ESS 9128 DAC in v163.1? Shhh don't tell anyone.... ;)

A little backstory.

I remember when I first found the True Native Mode code, I was like ooh what's that. Then I looked up online what True Native Mode was, the highest performance state of a computer, I was like cool. They left about 0.5% of the True Native Mode code in the original mixer_paths_tasha.xml file, I put the other 99.5% of the True Native Mode code together myself. Just think if they would have never left that small peace of code in the original mixer_paths_tasha.xml file this would have never had happened. Even more strange is that the 0.5% of the code I found, had the headphone side and the DAC side even the mixer paths, in other words everything was there to recreate the True Native Mode code. Almost like someone left it there deliberately? Another thing that is odd, is why would they put a Saber DAC chip in a phone that accepts the True Native Mode code programing? Why not just disable that on the chip it's self? All these unanswered questions, I guess we will never know. It's like if someone gave you the secret formula to make GOLD, wouldn't the first thing on your mind be, let's make some GOLD!!!

Most likely they have a computer program that programs the QuadDAC for True Native Mode, me on the other hand, this True Native Mode code was all hand made by me. So in other words, the Lgv20 will sound like no other Hi-Res music player in the world. A computer program cannot replace the very essence, of what a human is able to accomplish when programing a QuadDAC.

Enjoy everyone…
