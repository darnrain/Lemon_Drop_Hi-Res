Welcome to v155.1
Well this is a change, normally I would be saying right about now, I improved the audio quality. How ever nope, I just increased maximum power to the QuadDAC. This may also improve battery life on the Lgv20, when your not blasting your music that is.

If you remember when I first started to improve the audio quality, I said I am going to make the Lgv20 the worlds best sounding phone. I think we are getting close to that goal!!!

New location, new change log.

Enjoy everyoneâ€¦
