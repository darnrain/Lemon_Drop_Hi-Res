Welcome to v155.1
VBat = Voltage of the Battery.

Well this is a change, normally I would be saying right about now, I improved the audio quality. However nope, I just increased maximum power to the QuadDAC. I fixed vbat on the QuadDAC, so in other words the only time the QuadDAC will be running at maximum power is when your battery is 100%.

If you remember when I first started to improve the audio quality, I said I am going to make the Lgv20 the worlds best sounding phone. I think we are getting close to that goal!!!

New location, new change log.

Enjoy everyone...
